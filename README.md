# Mutnik Adventures

This is a simple website showing a world map with travel pins. Clicking on a pin opens a small gallery for that location.

## Development
Open `index.html` in your browser. The map is powered by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and ships with a local copy of the library under `vendor/leaflet`. Gallery pages use online placeholder images.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit the files to the `main` branch of your repository.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the `main` branch as the source.
3. Visit the provided GitHub Pages URL to see the site online.
