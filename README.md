# Mutnik Adventures

This is a simple website showing a world map with travel pins. Clicking on a pin opens a small gallery for that location.

## Requirements

```python
pip install pillow
```

## Development
Open `index.html` in your browser. The map is powered by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and uses local placeholder images so it works offline.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Commit the files to the `main` branch of your repository.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the `main` branch as the source.
3. Visit the provided GitHub Pages URL to see the site online.
